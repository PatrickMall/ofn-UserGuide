  platform.

# Features

You can browse these features at any time but for those just starting out we recommend our [quick start guides](../quick-start-guides/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To find the explanation of a specific feature that you need, please use the 'Search' field (top right hand corner).
{% endhint %}

In the rest of the guide the features of OFN are explained chronologically, with the order of sections following the logical order for setting up an enterprise. The guidance within each section is also structured so that guidance for basic usage appears first and more advanced guidance later in the section:

* [registration](register-and-create-your-profile.md)
* [enterprise profile setup](enterprise-profile/)
* [products](products-1/)
* [shopfront](shopfront/)
* [orders](orders/)
* [subscriptions](subscriptions/)
* [reports](reports/)
* [dashboard](dashboard.md)
* [groups](groups/)
